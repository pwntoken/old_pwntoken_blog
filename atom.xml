<p>Web Applications (Useful Applications which can be served in Web 2.0/3.0) today are rich and serve an intended purpose - be it to serve an ecommerce website or host a collaborative API to re-create <em>something useful</em> using <em>new ideas</em> for people and by the people. It&rsquo;s completely safe to assume web applications should have a generic SDLC (<em>software decelopment life cycle</em> or <em>system development life cycle</em>) compared to that of software (<em>as in thick client</em>) and not surprisingly - they do!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Software go through <em>phases of development</em> which is known as the <strong><code>SDLC</code></strong> and represents how a particular task is carried out periodically and efficiently for better code productivity in terms of functionality. A generic overview process of a SDLC is to break tasks into pieces so that they can me managed well and later integrated into a complete working <em>product</em> which can be <em>used</em> for the intended consumers of that product. Similarily Enterprise Web Applications go through <em>application development processess</em> and on each of these phases of the entire process, seperate developers working on an unit is responsible for that particular code and hence is the <em>code maintainer</em>. <code>SDLC</code> isn&rsquo;t short and static at Enterprise level but get&rsquo;s worse and complex when phases begin to shift from one stage to another. There are main ingredients such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Functional Project Management</li>
<li>Technical Project Management</li>
<li>Information Security Assurances</li>
<li>System Integration Test Plan/Integration Test Cases</li>
<li>User Acceptance Test Plan/ Acceptance Test Cases</li>
</ul>


<p>.. and most of what everyone else knows and what project managers are theoritically trained to prepare for boils down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Requirement Analysis</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Development</li>
<li>System Integration</li>
<li>User Acceptance and Parallel Testing</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Operations and Maintainence</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://s29.postimg.org/ncdjld2on/SDLC_1.jpg"></p>

<p>All of the aforementioned are packaged into the five super&rsquo;s i.e. functional project management, technical project management, information security assurances, system integration test plan and integration test cases and user acceptance test plan and acceptance test cases. We are more worried about <strong>Information Security Assurances</strong> and not long far in this way - we&rsquo;ll be introduced to how <em>information security</em> is governed and where SDLC is outruled by it&rsquo;s superset, and when precisely <em>*security</em> is to be placed into <code>SDLC</code> thoughfully by it&rsquo;s governing superset.</p>

<h2>But the Question Remains ..</h2>

<p><u>How Enterprise Web Application SDLC are any different from Software Product Based SDLC?</u> and <u>how shall security governance take place during the entire lifecycle?</u> Enter <code>ALM - Application Lifecycle Management</code>. To cut short of everything else and <del>leave details</del> to it&rsquo;s own research place:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Enterprise Web Applications <em>differ</em> in production, business case, and it&rsquo;s relative uses than that of a product applications. To elaborate - web applications might die fast due to it&rsquo;s trend nature, user acceptance or short life use case - <em>which means as long as the trend survives, the web application survives</em>, product software whilst might have <em>core re-use functionality</em> in operating systems (e.g. Microsoft Word? OpenOffice? ..). People leave Orkut to go newly obtained trend of Google+ and might never get sick of <code>#hashtags</code> at Facebook but they never leave <em>productivity software suite</em> installed in their PC/Laptop for <em>general core functionality</em> use.</p></li>
<li><p>To take care governance for both - Web Application Security as well as Software Security or for that matter all the five super ingredients we talked about earlier - we have <code>ALM</code> and it&rsquo;s really <em>not equal to</em> <code>SDLC</code>. <code>ALM</code> could be considered as the top gem mounted  above the <code>SDLC</code>, where <code>SDLC</code> lies in the bottom looking up at the <code>ALM</code> to manage it&rsquo;s <code>governance</code>, <code>development</code> and <code>operations</code>. The <code>ALM</code> has control of the <code>SDLC</code> - and <code>SDLC</code> has control of the <code>modular software/application deployment</code>.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Shritam! don&rsquo;t tl;dr ALM ..</h2>

<p>.. and so I won&rsquo;t. <code>ALM</code> as you now know is <code>Application Lifecycle Management</code>, it&rsquo;s easier to think of it as a <em>superset</em> of <code>SDLC</code>. If <code>SDLC</code> takes care of the operational part, the <code>ALM</code> takes care of it&rsquo;s governance. It&rsquo;s important to understand that <code>security</code> from it&rsquo;s very core has to be <em>governed</em> and <em>regulated</em> in authoritive perspective or code maintainers would continue to write bad code - and <strong>this</strong> exactly is <em>what happens to the most applications - be them web application or applications/products in general!</em></p>

<p>The three aspects of <code>ALM</code> is to provide:</p>

<ol>
<li>Governance</li>
<li>Development</li>
<li>Operations</li>
</ol>


<p>And all of these three factors are essential to run the show for <code>SDLC</code>, and ofcourse <code>SDLC</code> sometimes depend on it <em>operationally</em> if not for entire <em>development</em> (ever wonder about <code>DevOps</code>?). This is exactly where <em>security professionals</em> should be looking at! If one looks deeper thoughfully, any development criteria is only fullfilled by authorized operational means and if <em>operationally</em> security is placed forward - the <em>secure development</em> will become mandatory. There is a reason why I introduced <code>ALM</code> here because in layman terms:</p>

<blockquote><p>If project managers care not to outrule their developers to enforce security internally and make it mandatory, someone else have had got the system processes broken already!</p><footer><strong>Shritam Bhowmick</strong> <cite>His Information Security Diaries.</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Back to <code>ALM</code> basics, what we have is a raw idea which has a potential to either become an end-product for it&rsquo;s consumers and accepted by the massess in core functionality or it dies out and serves a short span of life to benefit from short-term use case/business case.</p>

<p><img src="http://s13.postimg.org/blw9dfkrr/ALM_1.png"></p>

<p>If the <code>security problem</code> at <em>operation level</em> has been identified, let&rsquo;s not forget to take a submarine-dive to explore what&rsquo;s beneath <code>ALM</code>.</p>

<h3><strong>Governance</strong> for ALM</h3>

<p>Take a <em>sweet note</em> - authorities always have a higher ground and what they only know is business, be it short termed or long termed - as long as it&rsquo;s beneficiaries are transparent, people will invest into the project. In <code>ALM</code>, to escalate ideas into businesses, there has to be a purpose; An application has to serve a purpose and then it should have a business value - this is the <code>business use case</code>. Everything else is High-Lower authority for the entire project and they are <code>project portfolio management</code> and <code>application portfolio management</code>.</p>

<p><img src="http://s1.postimg.org/7hmdr1nbj/ALM_Governance.png"></p>

<p>What they do specifically as part of the governance are simplified here.</p>

<p><strong>Business Case Development</strong>: Business Authorities hold the investment share, they have the equities, they know the business, they have stolen the idea ( .. or have them originally perceived!?) and now they are ready to invest on this BIG-O-BANG idea and wish not to lose out on the competitor game. They decide the finances. This first serious move is known to be <code>Business Case Development</code> or <code>BCD</code>.</p>

<p>To support the idea, there are peers who do the analysis for them (business authorities) and chalk out business use for the idea and if they are beneficial to the investors. If they are, business case is approved and application development might now proceed.</p>

<p><strong>Project Portfolio Management</strong>: The people who might have originally perceived the idea, might not have his/her own abilities to implement and transform it into a working product. They need someone else to do it for them and hence <code>people</code>, <code>processes</code> and <code>product</code> become the essentials for any organization.</p>

<p>There are two ways <code>Project Portfolio Management</code> or <code>PPM</code> is carried away - either a <code>project manager</code> is assigned the task with relative technical abilities to regulate a group of people who become the <code>core team</code> of that particular project or there is a dedicated <code>PMO</code> (Project Management Office) to regulate procedures at this level. Here actual development begins.</p>

<p><strong>Application Portfolio Management</strong>: If Application deployment is over, it&rsquo;s now an <code>asset</code> to the organization and more importantly the investors who have invested money into the project. There needs to be an ongoing check on it&rsquo;s beneficiaries and costs plus measures to check if the trend isn&rsquo;t dying and flipping out of it&rsquo;s way.</p>

<p><code>APM</code> or Application Portfolio Management provides a gateway to manage ongoing operation products, provide regulations around major revision (application or end-product software, as the case may be!) changes and perform updates keeping it&rsquo;s <code>business use case</code> in track and perform regular checks on it. If the trend persists, and the end-product or the application is feasibly performing well, updates for better performance, or added functionality is rolled out or a major updates are issued and released. This again needs checks from both <code>PMO</code> (or <code>PPM</code>) and <code>BCD</code>.</p>

<p>Now if we look down here, pretty much during the whole process of life start to life end of the application development or software application end-product development - the <code>governance</code> is constant and does not die out; and this also includes SDLC&rsquo;s in-between (during which the <code>governance</code> hasn&rsquo;t died out either! and as described SDLC is only a part of the entire process).</p>

<h3><strong>Development</strong> for ALM</h3>

<p>Yet again, take a <em>sweet note</em> here - it&rsquo;s not always feasible or necessary for an organization to stick to traditional SDLC i.e. <code>RAD</code>, <code>Waterfall</code>, etc. <code>Iterative</code> might be sometimes the need of the time and more modern organizations have been using them.</p>

<p><img src="http://s16.postimg.org/8ndjypyx1/ALM_Development.png"></p>

<p>Development is a fundamental necessity for any <code>custom web application</code>, an <code>Enterprise Product</code> or any <code>End Product</code> and this is precisely the <code>security gone wrong</code> point which has <code>SDLC</code> phases in it. During the entire ALM, the <code>SDLC</code> is a part of the lifecycle and it&rsquo;s this point where <code>security professionals</code> should target and permanently set a reminder for a <code>security cross check</code>.</p>

<p>Now, as talked before - generic <code>SDLC</code> has <strong>seven phases</strong> and equally there are <strong>seven security solutions</strong> to neutralize <code>security risks</code> specifically at those places.</p>

<p><img src="http://s16.postimg.org/akevh1eyt/SDLC_3_Security.jpg"></p>

<p>As to keep <code>security point-of-view</code> in reminder, here are the clauses for these <strong><u>specific security solutions at specific phases of a SDLC</u></strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Code Review</li>
<li>Risk Analysis</li>
<li>Penetration Testing</li>
<li>Risk-Based Security Tests</li>
<li>Abuse Cases</li>
<li>Security Requirements</li>
<li>Security Operations</li>
</ol>


<p><code>Security Operations</code> will be talked about when we discuss on <code>Operations</code> segment of <code>ALM</code> where it&rsquo;s an integral ongoing security process. Based on what we have covered so far, we have <code>code review</code> which is to be placed during <em>developing code (development)</em> and this can have:</p>

<ul>
<li>static code analysis and review</li>
<li>dynamic code analysis and reviw</li>
</ul>


<p>.. and then there is <code>Risk Analysis</code> which is covered both during <em>requirements/use case planning</em> and <em>architectural design</em>. <code>Penetration Testing</code> is to be done both and as part of <code>testing</code> and <code>maintainence/feedback from the field</code> which if elaborated falls under the following types of tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>black-box penetration testing</li>
<li>white-box penetration testing</li>
<li>grey-box penetration testing</li>
<li>glass-box penetration testing</li>
</ul>


<p>To really define these and cross the margin more:</p>

<p>A <code>black-box penetration test</code> means there are no external or internal informational put upfront and security professionals should identify and abuse security loopholes externally and if required <em>offensively</em> go indepth of the flaw which means <em>exploiting</em> necessary security flaws to it&rsquo;s deepest extent.</p>

<p>A <code>white-box penetration test</code> means there would be full feedback from the developers or <code>ALM</code> project managers to pin-point <em>resources of interest</em> and if required additionally provide <em>access credentials</em> to <em>security test</em> restricted zones. This sometimes is the industry de-facto because it&rsquo;s efficient.</p>

<p>A <code>grey-box penetration test</code> means to provide necessary <em>resources of interests</em> while the penetration testers are encouraged to find security flaws on their own but not limiting them to be short of credential request, if necessity be!</p>

<p>A <code>glass-box penetration test</code> is new modular penetration test where <code>security test monitoring</code> are placed (often times automated) and people monitor the activities of penetration testers while penetration testers are performing the test.</p>

<p><code>Risk Based Security Test</code> is a suite of <em>Security testing</em> for <em>test plans</em> that are prepared which has to be formulated into the <em>development code</em>, the code is at <em>staging</em> area and isn&rsquo;t gone <em>productional</em> yet. <em>Abuse Cases</em> is where testers pre-discuss how a certain business model could be abused and in what ways it could be defended providing the right solutions in very early phases of the <code>SDLC</code> which is <em>Requirements Planning and Use Cases Development</em>. <code>Security Requirements</code> as fit as per the necessary feedbacks from <code>abuse cases</code> and also performed for <em>Requirements Planning and Use Cases Development</em> phase.</p>

<p>Now if the <strong>Mammoth Security Gap Problem</strong> has been accessed right and the equation is to solve this <strong>security gap</strong>, <code>SDLC</code> is specifically where <em>security professionals</em> should start looking at and because this now has been <strong>scientifically proven</strong> and <strong>deduced</strong> out!</p>

<p>Back to <code>ALM</code>, the part of lifecycle which we discussed have <code>SDLC</code> and this is where <strong>Security gap</strong> exists. There is another part of the problem which has to be ruled out and i.e <code>Maintainence</code>. As <em>developers</em> begin to write <em>code</em> and business case demands more functionalities, more <em>code</em> is generated using frameworks and these in turn have adverse effects ranging from <em>introduction of vulnerabilities</em> from frameworks itself. <code>Code Maintainence</code> have two popular entities:</p>

<ol>
<li>Updates</li>
<li>Patches</li>
</ol>


<p>.. and both of them could do either of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>either break functionality and feasibility</li>
<li>or break security without letting anyone know</li>
</ol>


<p>.. and both of the aforementioned isn&rsquo;t preferred. This is exactly where <code>ALM</code> has another level i.e. <code>Operations</code> where for specifically <code>security</code> concerns, an organization should have a <code>security operations center</code> to identify vulnerabilities and threat them.</p>

<h3><strong>Operations</strong> for ALM</h3>

<p>No more <em>sweet notes</em>, it&rsquo;s tl;dr: <code>DevOps</code>.</p>

<p><img src="http://s1.postimg.org/qjakg2b0v/ALM_Operations.png"></p>

<p>Soon after applications are deployed from <code>staging</code> to <code>production</code>, they start receiving <code>patches</code> and <code>updates</code>. To cope up with these the application has to be managed throughout it&rsquo;s entire lifecycle and is now bond with the developers and the development team. The people who take care basically of both are <code>DevOps</code> and a <code>security operations center</code> here should be excactly placed here to do a routine check of <code>patches</code> and <code>updates</code> and release <code>security fixes</code> for <code>updates</code>, <code>patches</code> or <code>deployment code</code> as well.</p>

<p>And in this way <code>security management</code> is closely packed with <code>SDLC</code> and <code>SDLC</code> is pushed forward keeping <strong>security as a process and not as a product</strong>. This should be the case but ..</p>

<h2>is <em>security testing</em> an intergal part of most organizations?</h2>

<p>And Now we have been asking the <em>right question</em>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2><em>and the following isn&rsquo;t discouraging!</em></h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s why software security would always be a growing concern for leading technologies as well as for them who depend on these technologies e.g. corporations, companies, industry, small scale businesses and at a personal level social sites too. What we are talking here isn&rsquo;t related to a set of standard de-facto technology but what we <strong>are</strong> talking about is the <strong> <em>economics</em> </strong> of related web application software, their technologies and how they can be measured in order to provide a continious flow of quality in security.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Almost everytime a new standard, or a technology is released - it <em>does</em> contain <em>vulnerabilities</em>. Most often, these vulnerabilities are either hunted down using platforms such as <em>bug bounty</em> or otherwise dealt with privately via internal security team or traded in terms of a <em>0day</em>. It&rsquo;s no more about <em>how</em> one was able to compromise the applications in order to gain/trade or protect data but <em>how</em> it could had or has been important to make <em>an impact</em> to the business in concern. Almost all technical security researchers can deal with <em>identifying vulnerabilities</em> and claim they had been protecting the industry - but how about <em>measuring</em> these vulnerabilities in terms of <u><em>monetary impact to the business concerned?</em> </u>  This post is to talk about <em>that corner</em> of web application security industry which hasn&rsquo;t been much appretiated but still remains the core foundation to providing <strong>real security</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://s14.postimg.org/5u25o02td/solution.jpg"></p>

<p>To <strong> <em>quantify</em> </strong> the expenditure spent due to  the presence of a vulnerability or a chain of vulnerabilities isn&rsquo;t an unknown art - but it is percieved to be as the most analytical security research art and therefore requires patience and core understanding about the vulnerability - most importantly <em>business wise in terms of quantifying them in monetary impact</em> and also in terms of <em>technical impact which could lead to furthur compromise or weaken a particular asset</em>. To me there are three categories of businesses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Industrial scale business</li>
<li>Retail scale business</li>
<li>Personal scale business</li>
</ul>


<p>To each having it&rsquo;s own valuation in the market and having said that I furthur look at asset classifications for them; which is for an example a stock market would be an industrial scale business and they might have these assets:</p>

<ol>
<li>people</li>
<li>investors</li>
<li>investments</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, taking the same example, it&rsquo;s self-evident that <em>people</em> lead to <em>processes</em> in their business as per their role; this could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>HR role</li>
<li>Employee role</li>
<li>Adminstration role</li>
</ul>


<p>Furthur categorization of the targeted asset value will lead to realization that most targeted attacks should be (<em>atleast in my personal opinion</em>) Employee role and Administration role since they the people who have the keys to the technical foundation and now that it&rsquo;s realized that these keys will lead to the door which weren&rsquo;t meant to be open - it&rsquo;s <em>seldom</em> that the <em>people in the processess</em> such as this, become the victim of attacks. At one hand, these people have the keys that lead to <em>secure access/trusted access to data</em> and then at the other hand these are the same people who are least trained to handle a security operation or not trained enough for security policies (<em>even if security policies are enforced</em>). A realistic example here could be <a href="http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/incident-detection/dhs-confirms-u-s-public-utilitys-control-system-was-hacked/">compromise of U.S. PUCS SCADA</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://s8.postimg.org/hlt0gqp79/statistics_vuln_industry.jpg"></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s take for an example a <em>Retail scale business</em> which by far can be any from a cyber security company to a ecommerce based company, a a ventured start-up or a well established commercial platform. These businesses run on <em>consumers</em> that they rely on and hence the most likely target will be <em>consumers</em> and their data. Ofcourse there are other assets such as <em>employees</em> - <em>IT Department employees specifically</em>. Categorization of asset once again will lead to an evaluation of what audience target should most likely be! A realistic example here could be <a href="http://www.techworld.com/news/e-commerce/e-bay-magento-e-commerce-platform-hacked-by-credit-card-fraudsters-3617851/">the breach of E-bay leading to credit card information exposed</a>.</p>

<p>For the third example - <em>personal scale industries</em>, there&rsquo;s social network which people rely on, small scale businesses which are growing but are striggling hard. Most targeted asset should be a single person who holds the data of value. Once this particular asset is compromised, the industry is compromised as well too. This isn&rsquo;t only about the personal industry but by compromising an entire range of information also leads to affect lives of others. A more realistic scenario could be a breach where <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/20/us/josh-duggar-ashley-madison/">Asley Madison&rsquo;s site was compromised</a> or see <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ashley-madison-hack-psychological-fallout_55d4afcee4b07addcb44f5d4?kvcommref=mostpopular&amp;ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000063&amp;section=india&amp;adsSiteOverride=in">Psychological Impact of a Sensitive Hack</a> - the one which lead to confusions with so many relationships and sometimes when it takes a techical breach to cause a havoc.</p>

<p>Out there is a <strong>huge</strong> economy of relatively <em>economic impact vulnerabilities</em> which are sadly either neglected or often too underestimated in evaluation and therefore <strong> <em>security testing</em> </strong> becomes a repetative failure. What could be a more wonder that a <a href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/2943968/data-breach/hacking-team-hacked-attackers-claim-400gb-in-dumped-data.html">hacking team, the one responsible to hold security for others landing up hacked themselves</a>?</p>

<p>Hence the study of <em>economics of web application security</em> or for that matter <em>information security</em>/<em>network security</em> or <em>application security</em> in general is <strong>that</strong> (emphasized!) important. Take-away pointers:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Translate technical understanding of vulnerabilities to <strong>monetary terms</strong> or how well it can <strong>impact business in monetary terms</strong> and being able to leverage protection mechanisms against the same.</p></li>
<li><p>The first pointer will lead to effectively gain an insight of <strong>cost of vulnerabilities</strong> to the owner of the business and hence the <em>chief security officer</em> be able to develop a fair plan to chart <strong>measurements for <em>return on investments</em> (ROI)</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Being able to provide an accurate budget set-up on security and able to understand it&rsquo;s <em>return on investment</em>, the <strong>protection mechanisms placed</strong> can be more hardened and pre-planned with <em>Red Team exercies</em>.  Assign <strong> <em>appropiate</em> resources</strong> to pro-actively <strong>manage information security risks</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>All of the aforementioned three-pointers play a vital role in an industry to access it&rsquo;s security risks. Now, that we are talking about economics - the question remains how such assessments could be made easy and how <del>narrower</del> can be the road to this achievement?</p>

<p>Answer is it <strong>takes years of expertise and understanding impact</strong> by not fueling the <strong>easy way out to vulnerabilities</strong>. I have had that taste of <strong>bug bounty programs</strong> which are mostly never meant to close the <strong>monetary impact</strong> of a particular vulnerability but instead <strong> <em>focus on the softer technical side</em> </strong> and close out the <strong> <em>bugs</em> </strong>. Again, these are <em>bugs</em> and not <em>security threats as a whole</em>. Rare could be such occasions where <em>a valuable monetary vulnerability</em> has been reported. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/behind-the-scenes/charts">VRP chart from Google</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/_/rsrc/1422631746620/behind-the-scenes/charts/trafficdist.png"></p>

<p>&hellip;  and that doesn&rsquo;t really <em>motivate</em> me.</p>

<p>Here are some quick pointers/gotcha&rsquo;s from this chart alone:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Monetary to <del>security researchers</del> (now that they claim to be!) for hasteful reports <a href="https://www.bbhq.net/forums/topic/3/adobe-what-a-joke"><strong>just to gain rewards</strong></a> is a plain dis-respect to self-respect but could be professionally a no-harm&#8217;er. But tl;dr <em>the bug bounty program</em> cannot itself expect more and hence is <a href="http://thehackernews.com/2013/10/Yahoo-bug-bounty-program-reward-vulnerability.html"><em>always gentle</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Realizing a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-bug-bounty/bug-bounty-highlights-and-updates/818902394790655">percent of valid reports</a> are made and ofcourse <strong>awarded</strong> does not verify the fact that it <em>had</em> <a href="http://shubh.am/the-deterioration-of-unmanaged-bug-bounties/">any monetary impact on the business</a>. Relaity check more vulnerabilities are dependent on each other and hence <em>often times</em> <strong> <em><u>a chain of vulnerabilities</u></em> </strong> which has to exist the same time as of depecndency of existence of others lead to a <strong>critical threat</strong>. Ofcourse, this too has a narrow window with <del>security researchers</del>.</p></li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s real that <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/bug-bounty-program-insights/">Perspective is everything</a> but let&rsquo;s just say sometimes a persistent <em>hackerhat</em> cowboy either way does what they had always wanted to do and <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/15823/">it&rsquo;s not yet secure-proof</a> but let&rsquo;s just <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/backtrack/offsec-web-server-hacked/">stay strong</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip; <a href="https://medium.com/@Anonymous_India/the-truth-about-nakul-mohan-7e9c84d733c9">Really</a>?</p></li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://s27.postimg.org/yctiz01nn/reallyohmy.png"></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an epic legend for a <del>security researcher</del>!</p>

<ul>
<li>What one <strong>should had gotten away</strong> with pointer above is this:</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://s21.postimg.org/j9agzia53/youget.png"></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&hellip; and what <a href="http://www.ubercomp.com/posts/2014-01-16_facebook_remote_code_execution"><strong><u>an accurate security research looks like</u></strong></a> had quarter more the price economy as of the previous. I highly doubt this is the best management of crowdsourced vulnerabilities and if not - very dissapointed overall.</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip; and to add <em>Managed Bug Crowd</em> isn&rsquo;t really <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/security/our-private-bug-bounty-program-reducing-vulnerabilities-leveraging-expert-crowds"><strong> <em>private</em> </strong></a> as claimed. It&rsquo;s doorway to <em>private accessess</em> lies in keys to the kingdom of already <em>open public</em> bug bounty managed crowd sourcing and whosoever chooses to <em>obtain a minimum criteria</em> to access the private zone is able to get it - <strong>no matter how they reach there</strong> but sometimes there are <a href="http://homakov.blogspot.in/2014/02/how-i-hacked-github-again.html">people who do what they do</a>.</p></li>

<h2><em>problem with economics of security</em></h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s just another side of evaluating security risks and that could be the darker side. Security risk evaluation in terms of economics isn&rsquo;t well defined, complete or has any standardization but there does exists methodologies and practices such as ..</p>

<ol>
<li>NIST</li>
<li>OWASP</li>
<li>WASC</li>
<li>etc ..</li>
</ol>


<p>To cut short, <strong>there isn&rsquo;t any magic equation to be precisely accurate</strong> about security since <strong>quantity does not equal to quality</strong> and where there is <em>quality</em>, it isn&rsquo;t necessary the <em>risk is accessed by the brighter side</em>. What this means is if organizations haven&rsquo;t yet taken the appropriate measures to access it&rsquo;s security risks and quantify vulnerabilities in terms of:</p>

<ol>
<li>monetary lossess</li>
<li>reputational losses</li>
<li>asset informational lossess</li>
</ol>


<p>.. it&rsquo;s an end game at the end of the day - the darker side already might have the data one is trying to protect. Hence working to <strong> <em>solve the security equation proactively</em> </strong> might just be the wisest decision a CIO could ever made.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s solution to this existing problem and whilst escalation could be <em>internally managed and solved</em>, it isn&rsquo;t always the only way and it&rsquo;s necessary to understand why. Let&rsquo;s solve this in the upcoming posts to come-by and stay tuned folks. One liner take-away!</p>

<p>If you drove off here to know about the Octopress framework and get started rapidly over in a hour, this could be your best bet or you could always research and end up in thousand more blogs and end up on the same thing except only after having lost hours linking one solution to another problem and vice versa.</p>

<h2>Why migrate to Octopress?</h2>

<p>Why would a chap like me want to migrate from Wordpress to Octopress? For that I would first need to answer problems with the basic setup and i.e: PHP/MySQL stack - a complete stupid stack with needs to update plugins/code, etc. in a long run, generate more dynamic pages, parameters, etc in order to exhale more security loopholes.</p>

<h4>Pointers:</h4>

<ul>
<li>I never wanted to maintain security updates</li>
<li>Being in Security, I know the pain</li>
<li>A nice attempt to keep it clean</li>
<li>Not at all for novice users</li>
<li>Above gives heartache</li>
</ul>


<h2>In a Nutshell</h2>

<h2>Deploying to Github:</h2>

<hr />

<ul>
<li>create a new repository at Github, this is fairly self explanatory.</li>
<li>the host machine must have Ruby, Github and Octopress downloaded via Git.</li>
<li>Now that, everything is ready, move to octopress folder and run: <code>rake setup_github_pages</code></li>
<li>set the repository URL from Github when asked.</li>
<li>run rake generate via <code>rake generate</code></li>
<li>run deployment. This might ask username and SSH keys password from Github; Use <code>rake deploy</code></li>
<li>check git status to look if anything is uncommited; Use <code>git status</code></li>
<li>to push any changes into the remote github repository, use below:</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before you commit to Octopress</h2>

<p>There are basics if one really would need to customize and initiate the power of octopress to the next level. One does not simply limit himself to understanding of markdown but there&rsquo;s a lot <del>under-the-hood in the octopress framework</del> (<em>not really</em>, take time reading!).</p>

<p>Octopress 3.0 makes it more simpler but here I would be using Octopress 2.0 in it&rsquo;s truest and meanest form possible since it&rsquo;s easy and isn&rsquo;t tough for one from a developer background. That been said, here are some pre-requisities suggested (<del>although not mandatory</del>, but it is!)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Octopress documentation could be a great place to start with. Here&rsquo;s <a target ="_blank" href="http://octopress.org/docs/">the web documentation</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Markdown basics and additional markdown cheatsheets could be a benifit. Start with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">DaringBall Markdown Basics</a>. A good amount of <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/markdown-processing-ruby/">pointers on markup summarization</a> has been done by Jesse Herrick. Take time going through them as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Before you do down deeper, know what are different parsers which are used with octopress installation and take liberty to understand <code>rDiscount</code>, <code>Kramdown</code> and <code>Shopify Templates</code> or one can also read through the documentation covered here in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll go hand-in-hand with Octopress 2.0 and Octopress relies on it&rsquo;s support, however this has come to an drastic change since <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">release of Octopress 3.0</a>.</p></li>

<p>Octopress Code Plugin:</p>

<p>Markdown Method: tab (indent) in your code.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Sample Code Example</em> Block using tab indenting:</p>

<pre><code>var framework = "octopress";
</code></pre>

<p>Backtick Method: open and close with three backticks.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (backtick.js)</span> <a href='http://pwntoken.github.io/downloads/code/backtick.js'>download</a></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Include Code: file is stored in the octopress source directory, and one can include the code from the file. The user needs to use the /config.yml and there would be code_dir set to the default one.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2>Fixes and Work-Arounds!</h2>

<p>These are some of the fixes which I though might be just helpful when not using any automation for markdown via editors such as Atom, etc .. if you are writing in raw text and believe it&rsquo;s going to be all easy - trust me it&rsquo;s not going to be!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fix &ldquo;Liquid Exceptions&rdquo;</strong> - common symptoms are &lsquo;tags not closed&rsquo; etc .. Here&rsquo;s a hint for you - always close tags in proper syntax such as for blockquote:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fix color compatibility</strong> with proper liquid code block usage. This one, I needed documentation help and also existing Kramdown userbase help. I had a friend who suggested me to use the below code for all octopress documentation code in liquid since it&rsquo;s markdown support with color is amazing and Rdiscount parser which ships with octopress does not cry about it!</li>
</ul>

<p><u><em>Note</em></u>: you&rsquo;ll notice I have had used <em>include code</em> method instead of <code>codeblock</code> to illustrate my example in the above code snippet. The reason is I would had to iterate the <code>raw</code> and <code>endraw</code> liquid markup and escape opening liquid markup. This is however possible using <code>assign</code> operators; however I have had not done the research on it and it somehow rendered the entire code bad.</p>

<ul>
<li>Having been into security, I would <em>really</em> need to illustrate code snippets which carry special information and thos which deal with non-ASCII, such as <code>&amp;#x3c</code> and such. <strong>Special Characters in Octopress</strong> could be used using the method as shown above i.e via using <code>raw</code> and <code>endraw</code>. Have a look at the Sample code below!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fix <em>liquid exception</em> <strong>undefined method <code>[]</code></strong> on octopress might just be a time consuming research. I have it before-hand for you. So, the ground fact is here&rsquo;s what you might end up sometime while doing a <code>rake generate</code> and hence the parser not being able to <em>completely</em> generate the markdown files (e.g. below)</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://s23.postimg.org/k2ylvsmmz/fixundefined.png"></p>

<p>To solve this, goto the <code>.pygments-cache</code> and <code>rm .pygments-cache</code> directory as a whole as shown below in your octopress installation.</p>

<p><u><em>Note</em></u>: ignore <code>The system cannot find the path specified.</code> since they are generic custom <code>cmd</code> environment errors and not related to octopress, it&rsquo;s ruby dependency or python pygments highlighter dependencies.</p>

<p><img src="http://s30.postimg.org/wx0nlazht/deletepygments.png"></p>

<p>This <em>issue</em> persists with Windows installations and haven&rsquo;t been found in linux installations. I had however tried <em>re-installing python 2.7.x</em>, <em>re-installing ruby 2.2.x</em>, and everything else which were possible but all solution ended up to this <em>working method</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To fix and be <u>choosy</u> of your <em>markdown processor</em> not being able to provide with you with good alternatives for code block, you do know it&rsquo;s customizable and you can always have a <code>GitHub Style</code> combination <a href="http://blog.codebykat.com/2013/05/23/gorgeous-octopress-codeblocks-with-coderay/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>To fix <em>bullet/numbered</em> styling which ships as default and indents to cornering left of the actual article body, you will require to add below lines to <code>sass/custom/_style.scss</code>:</p></li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='liquid'><span class='line'>article {
</span><span class='line'>  ol, ul {
</span><span class='line'>    padding-left: 3em;
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>That was a short but a devasting ride for a start with the <code>Octopress Framework</code>. My recommendations would be to stick to the Octopress <em>documentation</em>, and research a lot in order to get a perfect working shape of your work.</p>

<p>Feel free to drop your queries below and I could test them to get a <code>new rake post task</code> for you under the octopress category section - laters!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Readers,</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I was in a move to port my old blog at pwntoken.wordpress.com to Octopress. I chose octopress over wordpress because of the functionality, the learning experience for the new age hackers and the speed. Along with the added repository at github, I had stood across on this one to be made available to the public from github site publishing service (git pages).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a couple of pointers I would like to add on this introductory post and what this blog would essentially be about:</p>

<ul>
<li>computer science</li>
<li>information security research</li>
<li>web application security research</li>
<li>network infrastructure security research</li>
</ul>


<p>A couple of other posts could make it out here. To get an overall abstract of the posts, it&rsquo;s recommended to take a note of the category section and then click on the link of your subject interest. The sole purpose of this blog is to serve personal research tracking to myself and keep a regulatory note of information security sciences for analytical study and it&rsquo;s development in past, present, recent and for future times; however the collected informational repository made out here could be used for essential incorporation of working knowledge into pratical driven measures given original credits are included and outcome of any code herein mentioned or copied does not hold any accountable responsibility to it&rsquo;s authors.</p>

<p>I hope the readers will find this blog informative and updated from time to time and will ensure a good resource overall for the information security community. I look forward to constant feedbacks, if any. Time to get back to the originals.</p>

<p>Regards,     <br/>
