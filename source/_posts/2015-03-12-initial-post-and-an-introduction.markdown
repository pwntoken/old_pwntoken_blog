This would be the very first post on Pwntoken. I have configured Octopress which has more features and control then Wordpress (http://www.pwntoken.wordpress.com) and decided to dedicate my posts here.

I have decided to post specific things here:

 - Recent events
 - My updates on pentests
 - Application Security Specific updates
 - Different code usability and coding in general

That's all for now; I hope this would be useful for others as well. Originally, this has been made for personal digital research and creating an archive of digital security updates.
