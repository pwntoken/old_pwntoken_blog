I am an independent application sceurity researcher. I have profesionally worked on different projects and have had experiences from the past on Red Team Leading. I have managed penetration testers with great learning experiences. To name some, I have worked on roles such as below:

	AVP (Associate Vice President) @Lucideus Tech
	Penetration Tester and Trainer @CTG Security Solutions
	Red Team Lead and Security Specialist @Defencely Inc.

Apart from covering more than 99+ penetration tests myself, I had led some of the greatest teams to recent developments worth the profit targeted and beyond. I have a short one liner for readers to 'welcome' you to my LinkedIn Network at http://www.linkedin.com/in/shritambhowmick

I am keen to associate, innovate and develop around digital security and provide my skill-set for a gaps which needs to be full-filled with worth. As a penetration tester myself, I had been also dependent on newer technological establishments providing more research oriented oppurtunities and hence open to feedbacks, general talks, brainstorming, discussions and association.
